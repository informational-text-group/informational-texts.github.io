              Addition is one of the most basic, and most used concepts in math. Most people will use math atleast once in their daily life. For example, calculating how many fruits you've bought at the store, to then calculate the price based on the amount of fruits.
              Addition, is where you add two or more numbers to one another to create a sum. The sum, is essentially the total of the integers, or complex numbers you are adding together.

              Addition tables are a great way to show the basic idea of addition.
              If you are familiar with multiplication tables, then addition tables are basically the same thing, except with addition.
              However, the only difference is that with addition, it is much easier to not remeber the addition tables, like with multiplication.
              Addition is much easier to understand without memorising a table, especially when you get into adding more than two numbers, greater than 9.

              <b>Basic Addition Strategies</b>

            <p>
              There are many different ways to add two numbers. The most common, and easy to understand addtion strategy, is stacking the numbers
              you want to add vertically, then adding the numbers from each column, then the number in the same column in the row below. The way it
              is explained here may be hard to understand, but once you are shown a visual example, it will be much easier to understand.

              Here, you can see how vertical addition would work, as explained in the previous paragraph. This is normally a strategy taught early on in school,
              to help students add large numbers to one another. Another concept that branches off of vertical addition, is carrying numbers. Normally, you'll have
              to carry numbers when the two numbers you are adding in the right most column is greater than 9. The extra digit, would be carried over to the column
              directly to the left of the column that had a number greater than 9. For example, if you were adding 25, and 25, you'd first add the five and five to
              get 10. This number is greater than 9, so you'll have to carry the extra number in the tens spot. which means below the 5 and 5, you'll put a zero, then add
              a 1 to the column on the left. So, the column on the left will become 1 + 2 + 2, equalling 5. So, below the 2 + 2, you'll put a 5. Your total will be 50. This can be verified using a calculator.
