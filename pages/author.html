            Hello, my name is Michael S. and I'm a young developer. Currently, I'm programming in rust, and doing some web development.
            As you may be able to see, I'm someone who enjoys having a very minimalistic website. It may look ugly, but it's what looks
            good to me. Apart from that, I've been programming for about 2 years. I started programming when I was 11. I haven't stuck
            to a single language though. I usually look throuh a bunch of programming languages until I find a language I like, I use it,
            then I ditch it later on. The few programming languages I have focused on for an extended period of time though, are rust and
            go. I also have some other hobbies. I like to write, and I enjoy building legos. One of my current lego projects is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbESrId0TfM">lego bowling alley</a>.
            As of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEo3fCDJfW0">version 2</a> of my lego bowling alley, more of it is made of wood.
            For my bowling alley, it is made mostly of balsa wood.

              <b>Experience</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              In total, I have 2 years of programming experience, evenly spread out across a few languages. Most notably, Rust, Python
              Java, C++, C, and Javascript. My favorite languages are Rust, Python, and Javascript. With Javascript I've made a <a href="https://bizzypythonbear.github.io/Breakout-Game/">breakout game.</a>
              The only issue with this game is that it is very buggy, and collision doesn't work very well. Fortunatly, I'm working on a new Javascript
              game, with a lot more advanced features, like buttons. Buttons may not be advanced to most people, but when you are using vanilla Javascript,
              you have to implement the buttons from scratch, which was the worst thing on planet earth to try and do, but it was worth it in the end, since I ended up being able to refine it and now it's really easy to make buttons, clear buttons, change where they go, and all of that.

              <b>Writings</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              I've decided that instead of writing about news, I would write informational articles, about general topics in different fields, and subjects. These articles are brief, but will offer as much information as possible, in the most concise, yet informational form.
